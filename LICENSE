   ALL PROJECTS’ EXCHANGE REUSE INFINITE PROGRESS LICENSE (APERIP)    
                  Version 1.0 — For Mod Development 

				  

                             1. PURPOSE  
							 
  The APERIP License exists to encourage open sharing, reuse, and 
collective progress within the modding community. Its goal is to 
reduce unnecessary duplication of work, promote collaboration, and 
ensure that creative contributions remain freely available to 
everyone.  



                           2. PERMISSIONS
						   
  2.1 Anyone may freely and unconditionally use, copy, modify, merge, 
adapt, publish, distribute, and reuse any part of a project covered 
by this license.  
  2.2 These permissions apply to all forms of use, including 
derivative mods, expansions, educational purposes, or community 
projects.  
  2.3 No fees, restrictions, or conditions are required for access or 
reuse.  



                       3. SHARING REQUIREMENT  
					   
  3.1 Any project that incorporates content from an APERIP-licensed 
project must itself be released under the APERIP License.  
  3.2 Content originally shared under APERIP cannot be converted into 
closed, private, or restrictive forms.  
  3.3 In short: what is shared openly must remain openly shared.  
  
  

                           4. DISCLAIMER  
						   
  4.1 Projects under this license are provided as-is, without 
guarantees of functionality, accuracy, or compatibility.  
  4.2 Contributors are not responsible for any issues, damages, or 
outcomes that may result from the use of the content.  



                        5. COMMUNITY SPIRIT 
						
  5.1 APERIP is more than a set of permissions—it is a commitment to 
mutual growth.  
  5.2 Its guiding principles are: share openly, reuse freely, improve 
together, and progress without limits.  
  5.3 By using APERIP content, you join a community that values 
collaboration over competition.  



                              6. SCOPE  
							  
  6.1 This license applies to all projects and content explicitly 
marked as released under the APERIP License.  
  6.2 By using such content, you agree to follow and uphold the terms 
of this license.  



                               SUMMARY 
							   
  APERIP ensures that everything shared stays shared. Anyone can use 
the content without restriction, but all derivative projects must 
also remain open under APERIP—creating a cycle of exchange, reuse, 
and infinite progress.
